# Hyperparameters for YOLOv8 with Focal Loss
# This file contains hyperparameter settings for training with focal loss and dynamic class weights

# Optimizer settings
lr0: 0.01  # initial learning rate (SGD=1E-2, Adam=1E-3)
lrf: 0.01  # final OneCycleLR learning rate (lr0 * lrf)
momentum: 0.937  # SGD momentum/Adam beta1
weight_decay: 0.0005  # optimizer weight decay 5e-4
warmup_epochs: 3.0  # warmup epochs (fractions ok)
warmup_momentum: 0.8  # warmup initial momentum
warmup_bias_lr: 0.1  # warmup initial bias lr

# Loss component weights
box: 7.5  # box loss gain
cls: 0.5  # cls loss gain
dfl: 1.5  # dfl loss gain
pose: 12.0  # pose loss gain (pose-only)
kobj: 1.0  # keypoint obj loss gain (pose-only)
label_smoothing: 0.0  # label smoothing (fraction)
nbs: 64  # nominal batch size
overlap_mask: True  # masks should overlap during training (segment train only)
mask_ratio: 4  # mask downsample ratio (segment train only)
dropout: 0.0  # use dropout regularization (classify train only)

# Note: Focal Loss parameters (fl_gamma, fl_alpha) are not directly supported in current Ultralytics version
# This configuration focuses on using dynamic class weights and standard loss modifications
# The focal loss concept is simulated through other hyperparameters

# Dynamic class weights approach - using higher cls weight for imbalanced classes
cls: 1.0  # increased cls loss gain for better class balance (default 0.5)
label_smoothing: 0.1  # label smoothing to help with class imbalance

# Augmentation settings
hsv_h: 0.015  # image HSV-Hue augmentation (fraction)
hsv_s: 0.7  # image HSV-Saturation augmentation (fraction)
hsv_v: 0.4  # image HSV-Value augmentation (fraction)
degrees: 0.0  # image rotation (+/- deg)
translate: 0.1  # image translation (+/- fraction)
scale: 0.5  # image scale (+/- gain)
shear: 0.0  # image shear (+/- deg)
perspective: 0.0  # image perspective (+/- fraction), range 0-0.001
flipud: 0.0  # image flip up-down (probability)
fliplr: 0.5  # image flip left-right (probability)
bgr: 0.0  # image channel BGR (probability)
mosaic: 1.0  # image mosaic (probability)
mixup: 0.0  # image mixup (probability)
copy_paste: 0.0  # segment copy-paste (probability)
auto_augment: randaugment  # auto augmentation policy for classification (randaugment, autoaugment, augmix)
erasing: 0.4  # random erasing probability for classification training

# Dataset settings
single_cls: False  # train multi-class data as single-class
rect: False  # rectangular training
cos_lr: False  # cosine LR scheduler
close_mosaic: 10  # disable mosaic augmentation for final epochs
resume: False  # resume training from last checkpoint
amp: True  # Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) training
fraction: 1.0  # dataset fraction to train on (default is 1.0, all images in train set)
profile: False  # profile ONNX and TensorRT speeds during training for best inference speed
freeze: None  # freeze layers: backbone=10, first3=0 1 2
multi_scale: False  # vary img-size +/- 50%
overlap_mask: True  # masks should overlap during training (segment train only)
mask_ratio: 4  # mask downsample ratio (segment train only)
dropout: 0.0  # use dropout regularization (classify train only)
val: True  # validate/test during training
